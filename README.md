## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to do a colour gradient:

```css
.results-score {
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    hsla(256, 72%, 46%, 1),
    hsla(241, 72%, 46%, 0)
  );
}
```

I figured out how to make a div section have circular shape:

```css
.results-score {
  border-radius: 100%;
```

### Continued development

I continue to improve my knowledge of CSS Flexbox and how to make a design mobile responsie.
